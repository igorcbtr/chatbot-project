The main goal is to demonstrate basic request-response communication between a frontend (or terminal) and a backend server.

## 🚀 Features

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Node.js / Express (or Python / Flask, depending on your setup)
- **Frontend (optional):** HTML/CSS/JavaScript

## 📂 Project Structure
- `server/` – backend logic with predefined responses  
- `public/` – optional simple UI (if implemented)  

## ⚙️ How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
